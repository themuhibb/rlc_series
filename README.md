üí° Project Overview
The core purpose of this project is to simplify the complex calculations involved in AC circuit analysis. By handling the math for reactance and impedance, the program serves as an excellent educational tool for electrical engineering students and a useful utility for hobbyists and professionals. The output is formatted clearly, making it easy to check intermediate values and understand the entire process.

‚ú® Features
Interactive Console Interface: Prompts the user for all necessary circuit parameters.

Engineering Prefix Support: Accepts common prefixes like k (kilo), m (milli), u (micro), n (nano), and p (pico) for input values.

Comprehensive Calculations: Computes:

Inductive Reactance (X_L)

Capacitive Reactance (X_C)

Total Circuit Impedance (Z)

Total Circuit Current (I)

Voltage Drops across Resistor (V_R), Inductor (V_L), and Capacitor (V_C).

Dual Format Output: All calculated complex values (Impedance, Current, Voltages) are displayed in both rectangular (a+jb) and polar (r
angle
theta) forms.

Step-by-Step Breakdown: Shows the formulas and intermediate calculation steps to help in understanding the solution process.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
To compile and run this program, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system.

Windows: MinGW, Visual Studio

macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools

Linux: g++ (usually pre-installed or can be installed via your package manager)

Installation and Build
Clone this repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rlc-calculator.git
cd rlc-calculator
Compile the main.cpp file using your C++ compiler. For g++, use the following command:

Bash

g++ main.cpp -o rlc_calculator
This command creates an executable file named rlc_calculator (or rlc_calculator.exe on Windows).

Run the executable from your terminal:

Bash

./rlc_calculator
üìù How to Use
The program will guide you through the required inputs. Simply follow the prompts and enter the requested values. The program intelligently handles the units based on the prefixes you provide.

Example Input Prompts:

Enter the Measured Value of Resistance (Ohm, e.g., 1k):

Enter the Measured Value of Inductance (H, e.g., 100m):

Enter the AC Source Frequency (Hz, e.g., 60):

üß™ Example Walkthrough

--- Calculation Steps ---

Calculating Inductive Reactance (XL)...
Formula: XL = 2œÄfL
XL = 2(3.142)(60)(100.0 m)
XL = 37.700 Ohm

Calculating Capacitive Reactance (XC)...
Formula: XC = 1 / (2œÄfC)
XC = 1 / (2(3.142)(60)(470.0 n))
XC = 5.643 kOhm

Calculating Total Impedance (Z)...
Formula: Z = R + j(XL - XC)
Z = 100 + j(37.700 - 5.643 k)
Z = 100.000 + j-5.605 kOhm

Z in Polar Form:
Magnitude |Z| = sqrt(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)
|Z| = sqrt(100.000^2 + (37.700 - 5.643 k)^2)
|Z| = 5.606 kOhm
Phase Angle ‚à†Z = arctan((XL - XC) / R)
‚à†Z = arctan((37.700 - 5.643 k) / 100.000)
‚à†Z = -88.98¬∞

Calculating Total Current (I)...
Formula: I = V_source / Z
I = (10.000‚à†0¬∞) / (5.606 k‚à†-88.98¬∞)
I = 1.784 m‚à†88.98¬∞A

...and so on for the voltage drops...
